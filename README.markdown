## Acknowledgement

This extension is based on Nils Hörrmann’s [Backend Assets](https://github.com/symphonists/backend_assets) which is based on Michael Eichelsdörfer’s [Admin CSS Override](https://github.com/michael-e/admin_css_override) and steals some code from several other symphony extensions :)
